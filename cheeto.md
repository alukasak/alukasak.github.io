You may not always recognize me on the streets of Circleville — but chances are, you’ve seen my 1977 VW Van, affectionately known as **Cheeto-Love**.

Each week, I attend a variety of events across our community as I look for meaningful ways to **serve the people of Circleville**. True to my campaign slogan, **“Serving People, Not Parties,”** I’m committed to putting community first.

Check out my pictures below to stay updated as I support the many groups and individuals who make Circleville such a great place to live!
