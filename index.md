**Why I Serve --- A Message from Audrey Lukasak, City Council Member,
Ward 3**

In December 2024, I said \"yes\" when
asked to serve in a leadership role on Circleville City Council,
representing Ward 3. In my short tenure, I've been deeply inspired by
the people I've met and the issues we've faced together. That's why I am
choosing to continue this service --- because **the people of Ward 3
matter to me.**

I'm listening. I hear your concerns **about safety, housing, food
insecurity, and trust in government leadership**. I come to this role as
a **non-partisan voice**, **focused on people --- not parties** --- and
on **solutions that uplift** our entire community.

Some may not know me, as I moved to Circleville during
the pandemic. But maybe you've seen me around town in my bright pumpkin
orange 1977 VW van --- affectionately known as ***Cheeto-Love*.** That
van has a Circleville story too: it was a wedding gift to my sister and
brother-in-law, Linda and Warren Leist, from longtime residents Carl and
Geraldine Leist. *Cheeto-Love* reminds me every day of my commitment
**to keep moving this community forward --- together**.

I **chose to make Circleville my home** after the loss of my sister. I
moved here to care for my mother during hospice and purchased the home
my sister lovingly renovated. As a retired ELCA Lutheran pastor and
chaplain, I've served locally as an interim pastor at Trinity Lutheran
Church and Circleville Presbyterian Church, and as a chaplain with
OhioHealth and the Wexner Medical Center. These roles allowed me to
connect with our community in meaningful ways --- **building trust,
showing up, and listening.**

I **grew up in a small town** --- St. Clair, Michigan --- and I know both the joys
and the challenges that come with close-knit communities. Small towns
thrive when **neighbors look out for one another**. But they also face
real struggles when it comes to change and growth. Through my leadership
experience, I've learned how to find **balance:** **honoring tradition**
while seeking **creative and compassionate solutions** for today's
challenges.

Circleville deserves leadership **rooted in listening, respect for
diverse voices, collaboration, and trust.** That's the kind of
leadership I offer --- and the kind I will continue to bring to Ward 3.

**Let's keep moving forward, together.**
